# NEOSmartShades

This is a Homebridge plugin for the NEO Smart Shade Controller (See http://neosmartblinds.com/smartcontroller/).

These instructions are in rough draft form, but should be enough to get you started
Linux Installation Instructions to be added!

# I. Installing Homebridge on Windows 10

These instructions were originally written or installing HomeBridge on Windows 10, 64  bit. They should also work for earlier versions of Windows. 

** There are a number of steps that say to use Windows Command Prompt. **Do NOT try to use Windows PowerShell** instead. The install will fail if Windows PowerShell is used instead of Command Prompt. **

You should perform the following steps using the account that you will use to run HomeBridge.  This is because, by default, certain HomeBridge modules are installed in the logged-in user's account at: C:\Users\ _your user name_ \AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules and will not be accessible from other Windows accounts. I've found it helpful to set up a specific Windows "user" just for the running of HomeBridge (e.g., set up a new user under the login name "HomeBridge" or something like that, and then do the installation when logged in as that user).

## A.	Install Nodejs
These Windows install instructions have been tested with the v13.3.3 series of node so its recommended that you use a version in that series or later. Other version of NodeJS may work but haven’t been tested. You can download NodeJS here: https://nodejs.org/


## B.	Install Homebridge

Now install homebridge from a *new* Windows Command Prompt using the command:

     npm install -g homebridge


## C.	Test Homebridge
Open a new Windows Command Prompt (yes, it must be a newly opened one - don't re-use the prompt from preceding steps) and enter the command:

     homebridge
You should see some text displayed and a QR code. If so, HomeBridge installed correctly.

## D. Install Plugin

Once homebridge is installed, you are ready to install your plugins. The following instructions are to install the "HomeSeer" plugin, but you can also follow a similar pattern for other plugins.

First, if you used a prior HomeSeer plugin, you must remove it before installing this plugin. To delete the prior version of this plugin use:

     npm -g uninstall homebridge-smartshades


## E. File Locations
You will now need to create a config.json file for homebridge. By default, this should be placed in the folder:
   c:\users\ _[Your Root User Directory]_ \\.homebridge
   
A sample configuration file is in the following directory: https://github.com/jvmahon/homebridge-smartshades/tree/master/Config.Sample
   
   
For each shade, you will need to add an entry in the "shades": section of the config.json file. Each shade entry consist of a name as well as a Blind Code. For example, see the entry:
`````
				{"name":"Kitchen Window", 	"code":"145.149-01"}
`````        
The "code" part of this entry comes from the NEO Smart Blind app. Go to the "Advanced Controls" section and look for the code labeled "Blind Code:".
